## Process

If you have an idea for a topic that should be captured in an ADR, create a [new issue in JIRA](https://cm-jira.usa.gov/).

To propose a new ADR, create a new branch in this repo and use the ADR [template.md](template.md) to create your draft. When ready for review, create a pull request to the `main` branch. Discussion and suggested changes should take place on the pull request. When discussion are concluded, the branch can be approved and merged.

Finally, once a new ADR is added via merged PR, update [the log above](#architectural-decision-log).
